# webpack-restaurant
Project to build a restaurant page with webpack. 

a new project to build a restaurant page. the html/js/css related to website creation was very simple as this allowed a wide range of creativity making the design
easier than following set specs. 

the real challenge was the webpack but by carefully following the tutorial I made this without breaking anything. very interesting to set up a web page this way.
